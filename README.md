# nustar_solar
Scripts for converting NuSTAR solar observations to usable heliocentric coordinates.

Note that most of the scripts in here are dependent on both the nustar-idl repo's, the AstroLib, and (occasionally) the Coyote libraries.

Please clone the nustar-idl library here:  https://github.com/NuSTAR/nustar-idl and follow all instructions for cloning the AstroLib and Coyote repos before continuing.
